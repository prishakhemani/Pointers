# Pointers
# Theory
C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −

               type *var-name;
               
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk you used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. 

Following are the valid pointer declaration −

int    *ip;    // pointer to an integer

double *dp;    // pointer to a double

float  *fp;    // pointer to a float

char   *ch     // pointer to character

# Three main purposes of pointers:


1)to allocate new objects on the heap

2)to pass functions to other functions

3)to iterate over elements in arrays or other data structures
